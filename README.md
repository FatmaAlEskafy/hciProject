## ⚠️ Problems Identified in Original Design
1. **Visual Clutter**: Excessive visual elements making it difficult to focus
2. **Ineffective Carousels**: Forced waiting times affecting efficiency
3. **Poor Contrast**: Buttons lacking clear affordance and clickability
4. **Weak Navigation Visibility**: Ambiguous navigation options
5. **Visual Inconsistency**: Cognitive overload due to inconsistent design
6. **Affordance Violations**: Unclear interactive elements

## ✨ Redesign Highlights
